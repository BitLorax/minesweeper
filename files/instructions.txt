Welcome to Minesweeper 120!

The game board consists of 16x16 tiles, and 24 of these tiles have mines. Your goal is to uncover
all non-mine tiles without uncovering mined tiles.

Each non-mine tile has a number denoting the number of tiles around it that contain mines. The tiles
around it are defined as the 8 surrounding tiles (cardinal directions and diagonals).

Left click to uncover a tile, and right click to flag/unflag a tile. Flagging a tile prevents you
from uncovering the tile. You do not need to flag all mined tiles to win the game.

The smiley face is a reset button that restarts the game. The play button replays the current game
automatically. If the current game is not over, then you can continue uncovering tiles after
replaying.
